;; -- API ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This namespace represents the re-frame API
;;
;; Below, you'll see we've used this technique:
;;   (def  api-name-for-fn    deeper.namespace/where-the-defn-is)
;;
;; So, we promote a `defn` in a deeper namespace "up" to the API
;; via a `def` in this namespace.
;;
;; Turns out, this approach makes it hard:
;;   - to auto-generate API docs
;;   - for IDEs to provide code completion on functions in the API
;;
;; Which is annoying. But there are pros and cons and we haven't
;; yet revisited the decision.  To compensate, we've added more nudity
;; to the docs.

;; --  logging ----------------------------------------------------------------
;; Internally, re-frame uses the logging functions: warn, log, error, group and groupEnd
;; By default, these functions map directly to the js/console implementations,
;; but you can override with your own fns (set or subset).
;; Example Usage:
;;   (defn my-fn [& args]  (post-it-somewhere (apply str args)))  ;; here is my alternative
;;   (re-frame.core/set-loggers!  {:warn my-fn :log my-fn})       ;; override the defaults with mine
(def set-loggers! loggers/set-loggers!)

;; If you are writing an extension to re-frame, like perhaps
;; an effects handler, you may want to use re-frame logging.
;;
;; usage: (console :error "Oh, dear God, it happened: " a-var " and " another)
;;        (console :warn "Possible breach of containment wall at: " dt)
(def console loggers/console)


;; -- unit testing ------------------------------------------------------------

;; -- Event Processing Callbacks  ---------------------------------------------

(defn add-post-event-callback
  "Registers a function `f` to be called after each event is processed
   `f` will be called with two arguments:
    - `event`: a vector. The event just processed.
    - `queue`: a PersistentQueue, possibly empty, of events yet to be processed.

   This is useful in advanced cases like:
     - you are implementing a complex bootstrap pipeline
     - you want to create your own handling infrastructure, with perhaps multiple
       handlers for the one event, etc.  Hook in here.
     - libraries providing 'isomorphic javascript' rendering on  Nodejs or Nashorn.

  'id' is typically a keyword. Supplied at \"add time\" so it can subsequently
  be used at \"remove time\" to get rid of the right callback.
